# SQL-Analytics-Training
Upon completion of a course in SQL I started looking for real world problems in order to further train and develop my abilities and confidence in big data queries.
The following is a repository exploring the questions of Yammer, a communications software. Answered with a series of SQL queries that aim to focus solutions to specific problems.
The first problem is a drop in user enhgagements. I have written several SQL queries exploring the data sets involved. All queries on the engagement dip are in the same .sql file, seperated by comments on my thought process of the exploration.
