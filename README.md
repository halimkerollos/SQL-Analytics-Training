# SQL-Analytics-Training
Upon completion of a course in SQL I started looking for real world problems in order to further train and develop my abilities and confidence in big data queries.
The following is a repository exploring the data science questions of Yammer, a communications software. Answered with a series of SQL queries that aim to focus solutions to specific problems.

The first problem is a drop in user engagements. I have written several SQL queries exploring the data sets involved. All queries on the engagement dip are in the same .sql file, seperated by comments on my thought process of the exploration. 
Second Problem involved a vague question about the search function: is it good or should the engineering team dedicate time to improving it.
A lack of direction on this made it somewhat difficult to start but comping up with parameters helped focus exploration.
The third problem was about A/B testing done on a product feature. I was given the resuls and asked to verify them. This one was quite simple script wise because I was asked to start from the already written script of performing the statistical analysis on the A/B test. I only changed some parameters around to check if all the bases were covered and created a report with several of those script to compare with the original results.
